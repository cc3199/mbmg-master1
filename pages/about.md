## About The Montana Geological Society Maps and Cross Sections

This collection of maps and cross sections were recovered from the Montana Geological Societyâ€™s storage facility in Billings, MT.  The interpretive maps and cross sections were generated by petroleum geologists and members of the Montana Geological Society (formerly Billings Geological Society) during the last half of the 20th century. Most depict various aspects of geology related to oil and gas prospects. Some may be published in Montana or Wyoming Field Conference Guidebooks; others are unpublished.
